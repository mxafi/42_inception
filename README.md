# Inception

The Inception project is an engaging system administration exercise brought to you by Hive Helsinki and the 42 school system. This project is crafted to enhance your knowledge of Docker, containers, and images.

The primary goal of the project is to set up a WordPress site using separate containers for WordPress (php-fpm), Nginx, and MariaDB. It's crucial to note that all images must be built locally, and only base Alpine or Debian images are permitted for use as a FROM layer.
